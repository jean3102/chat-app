# Group Chat

In the following repository I show a group chat application. It is built with `react` and `node` using  `https://socket.io/` as a dependency 

 ### Install dependencies

```bash
  cd client 
       npm  install
  cd server 
       npm  install
```



## Running App

run the following command

```bash
  cd client 
       npm run dev
  cd server 
       npm run dev
```


Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open http://localhost:5173/ to view it in the browser.
